# Hello, World

I see you've happened upon my Github profile.

I'm a developer, as you might imagine, and I write a lot of JS.

My tools are Node, Express, Vue, and GraphQL. I also have done a ton of WordPress development.

You can contract me immediately via subscription to [Fueled on Bacon](https://fueledonbacon.com), my agency.

In some cases you can hire me directly to support your project.

If you want to get in touch, you can always email me at [ryan@fueledonbacon.com](mailto:ryan@fueledonbacon.com)
