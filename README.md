# Hello, World

I see you've happened upon my Github profile.

I'm a developer, as you might imagine.

I write mostly in Node, Express, Vue, and GraphQL. I also have done a ton of WordPress development in PHP.

I'm currently the CTO fro [ParOne](https://paronetv.com). We're building video distribution tools for sports media.

If you want to get in touch, you can always email me at [github@cwynar.dev](mailto:github@cwynar.dev)
