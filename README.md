# Hello, World

I see you've happened upon my Github profile.

I'm a developer, as you might imagine, and I write a lot of JS.

My tools are Node, Express, Vue, and GraphQL. I also have done a ton of WordPress development.

I'm currently the CTO fro [ParOne](https://paronetv.com). We're building video distribution tools for sports media.

In some cases you can hire me directly to support your project.

If you want to get in touch, you can always email me at [github@cwynar.dev](mailto:github@cwynar.dev)
