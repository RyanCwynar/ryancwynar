In 2016 I moved into a van. Many unique learnings went along with this experience. 

There's a lot of basic learnings that go with living in a van. You need solutions for food, showers, bathrooms, parking, sometimes heating. Sometimes cooling.

One of the biggest factors that made things a bit more normal was getting access to a nice coworking space. Somewhere big, secure, and comfortable where you can get work done and relax.

In Los Angeles at that time, there was a coworking space chain called CTRL Collective that I found which had amazing spaces.
