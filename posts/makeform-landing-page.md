title: The Makeform.ai Landing Page Might Be Great

description: It has all the elements needed to test the sentiment around an idea while exposing nothing.

This landing page is very simple.

It has little more than a Hero title, A description sentence, and a Try For Free button.

Clicking the Try For Free button leads to a beta access form. 

The form gathers email, twitter handle, and asks for a painpoint. 

The service may very well exist, and probably does, but it might not.

The homepage also suggests that the user can sign in, but this may also not be the case.

Pricing is not exposed, either. It simply indicates that the tool is in Closed Beta.

It might be a great way to perform single-blind experiments to gauge interest in a project.
