**Introduction:**

James Williams is a serial entrepreneur and software developer who started in the early 90s. He has been involved in 14 startups and now runs a software development agency. His background includes working for companies like Google, Symantec, and others, along with taking some companies public.

**What is a Fractional CTO?**

A fractional CTO provides leadership, strategy, and sometimes implementation for businesses that cannot afford a full-time CTO. This is ideal for startups and small businesses that need CTO-level insights but lack the budget for a full-time position. Fractional CTOs help with technology strategy, product roadmaps, and overall business goals at a fraction of the cost of a full-time CTO.

**Day-to-Day and Capacity:**

Williams’ team can typically manage about four to eight companies per year as fractional CTOs, depending on the size and development needs of the organizations. A smaller team might require less engagement, while larger companies with bigger development teams demand more involvement.

**Additional Services:**

Apart from fractional CTO services, Williams’ company offers traditional software development. They sometimes leverage their development team to solve specific business problems when necessary. While they do offer software development services separately, they focus on partnering for business outcomes rather than just selling developer hours.

**Pricing Structure:**

Williams has productized his services into three tiers: Solopreneur, Entrepreneur, and Enterprise, based on company size, revenue, and needs. The pricing for these packages is listed on their website, but they also offer custom packages when necessary.

**Ideal Clients:**

The ideal clients for Williams’ services are startups that have recently received or are about to receive investment, typically ranging from pre-seed to Series B. These clients are usually looking for more than just development services; they need a partner focused on achieving specific business goals.

**Typical Engagement Duration:**

Fractional CTO engagements usually last from eight months to a year. Often, the goal is to help the client hire a full-time CTO or build a team for long-term sustainability.

**Avoiding Conflict of Interest:**

Williams is cautious about recommending his own development team to clients while serving as their fractional CTO, as this can create a potential conflict of interest. He prefers to let the client suggest using his team rather than pushing for it himself. He aims to focus on achieving business outcomes rather than simply fulfilling a backlog of tasks.

**Outcome-Focused Implementation:**

Instead of billing based on hours, Williams emphasizes pricing based on business outcomes, such as increasing loan volume or reducing churn. He disqualifies potential clients who are more focused on micromanaging development tasks rather than achieving specific business objectives.

**Sales Process and Ideal Prospects:**

Williams has a defined process for prospecting, including cold outreach on LinkedIn and Twitter, where he offers valuable insights to engage potential clients. His close rate is high once he gets on the phone with prospects.

**Setting and Managing Expectations:**

To ensure alignment between the client’s expectations and the development team, Williams uses a demo-driven approach. Each demo focuses on qualitative goals, like achieving specific functionalities, rather than tracking quantitative metrics like lines of code or task completion. He also collaborates closely with clients to establish what success looks like at each stage.

**Working with Existing Development Teams:**

When engaging with companies that already have in-house developers, Williams focuses on partnering with those teams to establish an accountability plan. His approach involves setting clear expectations for demos and aligning on the desired outcomes rather than dictating tasks.

**Course Offerings and Knowledge Sharing:**

Williams also runs a technology accelerator to help engineers develop entrepreneurial skills. His goal is to empower engineers to negotiate better salaries, understand cap tables, raise money, and avoid the mistakes he made earlier in his career.

**Key Advice for Engineers and Consultants:**

Williams stresses the importance of diagnosing a problem thoroughly before accepting client requests. He encourages developers to challenge client assumptions and focus on business outcomes rather than just technical specifications. He believes that blindly following a client’s technical decisions without considering the business context increases the risk of failure.

**Conclusion:**

Williams’ approach emphasizes a partnership mindset, focusing on achieving business outcomes rather than simply delivering development tasks. His strategies for fractional CTO engagements and development services are geared towards companies looking to solve real business problems, rather than those simply seeking to outsource technical work.
