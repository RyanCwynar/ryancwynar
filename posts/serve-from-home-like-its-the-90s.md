So I started working on my home server.

## Why?

Well, I realized that I was paying about $100/month to AWS to run a couple t2.medium servers and some other small services. But when I considered the computing power on those machines… It was pretty weak.

I realized the average computers I have in my house are much more powerful, and I have a fiber connection that can server 500Gbps up. So why not just run my own servers? Especially in these early stages where I’m not generating a lot of revenue with a lot of customers.

## Benefits

There’s the added benefit of running open source versions of tools I would normally pay for.
- Automatisch replaces Zapier
- Umami replaces Google and Vercel analytics
- PM2 and Docker keep all my apps up
- Cloudflare tunnel ferries my traffic from the internet to my computer without having to expose my IP or pay for a static IP every month.
- Working “in production” is faster
